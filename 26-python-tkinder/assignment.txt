Hello, for this assignment, I need the code files and UML with class Diagram.
Please add comments on top of the code so I can see what is going on.
The assignments are:
Process:
The user (client) requests data from the (server) database. The database sends back the data to the user. At acquisition of the data an XYPlot is drawn.

DataFile:
UNData.xml

User Layer:
The user selects a country, and passes the country name to the Business Layer. Use Tkinter to produce a pull-down for the user to select a country. Send the selected country to the Business Layer.

Business Layer:
Receives the information from the User Layer and constructs a SQL query to send to the Data Layer. The query extracts the yearly data (1990,2017) for the requested country. The data may be queried either country year-by-year or in one query for year range. After receiving the JSON string back from the Data Layer, send the data to the Graphic Layer for plotting.

Data Layer:
Construct a SQL Database based on the data from the DataFile. Processes the queries from the Business Layer. Sends back a JSON string for the requested query.

Graphic Layer:
Use your Graphic Class or module defined in previous assignments to draw a MatPlotLib XYPlot.

Server Layer:
The database access is controlled by the Server Socket. The client sends a query, and the server sends a JSON string.

Client Socket:
Requests data from the server. After receiving the data from the server, the client displays the data.
